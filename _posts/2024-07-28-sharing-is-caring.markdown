My life has been a long journey. I've taken many paths in personal and professional contexts. I've navigated between the academic and corporative words.

I've found common behaviors between them. However, I'm not creating this blog to be another one in this immense virtual world. I want to share all the essential things that can help you evolve as a professional and a person.

I have one commitment to you. I will bring use cases to discuss technology. I will discuss all the things that excite me about technology, including topics like software architecture, domain-driven design, Java, Spring framework, frontend, and AI applied.

For each post, I will try to provide practical examples and references and balance the pros and cons.

Please enjoy reading as much as I'm enjoying writing this for you.

We will meet in the next post :)
