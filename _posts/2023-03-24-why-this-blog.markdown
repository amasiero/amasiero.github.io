I've been thinking and creating a blog to share my POV about career topics. It is not about coding stuff only. I will share some thoughts and reflections about daily tasks and founds.

In the last few years, I've been on a roller coaster in my career. I study technical things, but not only. I also read themes like leadership and personal growth topics. I like to share it with you.

## Really! A blog?

I'm facing new challenges in my life, so it is a way to document my journey in the new world. Also, explaining the topics in articles is a way to comprehend the subject studied.

I could put all these things in one private Notion workspace. However, sharing in a blog forced me to read all the information again and structure it in my mind. A second reason is it could be helpful to someone who is learning these topics too.

I hope you enjoy it as much as me.
