I'm **Andrey Masiero**.

I work as an **Senior Fullstack Engineer** aka **Coder** @ **[MotorK](https://motork.io/)**.

I am interested in building **high-performance**, **large-scale**, and **distributed web applications**. But I also like to work on **design systems** and **front-end**.

I am fascinated by **software design patterns**, **clean code**, **architecture design**, and the human factors in **software engineering**.

My main language is **Java**, but I also enjoy work with **Python** and **JavaScript/TypeScript**.

In my free time, you will find me **photographing**, **crossfitting**, and **reading books**.
